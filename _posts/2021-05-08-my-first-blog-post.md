Have you ever been stranded in an unknown environment, with no one to talk to who understands your languague?
If yes, you then saw a poster with a lot of text, but not writen in English. You are sure this sign-board is telling you something that would most likely save you, but how will you read this.

Well don't be puzzled no more. That was some Deep Learning wonders that just happened to you.
